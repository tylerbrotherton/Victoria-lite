# Victoria-lite
This is a victoria like game, except with more realistic features, no DLC ever, and save files will be transferable to a HOI4-like game(i.e. at the end of your game seccion, the map, technologies progression, population sizes, and 
political governce can be used for my HOI4-like game). Some bugs are expected becuase this was created by one person, but hopefully we can collectively fix my bad code. 

The author of all this code is "Tyler Brotherton" which is "tylerbrotherton" here on github and "tyler-brotherton" on LinkenIn

The author's comments were written late at night by tired/grumpy tyler, and are gruff/brusques social critisums of goverment, politics, countries, govermental insitutions, etc.
The author wants all new code uploaded to the codebase to follow the direction of the existing codebase, and shall not be removed unless it can be proven that the comments are
1. Profane 2. do not reflect the actual problems in societies 3. I'm always right, BO-YAH!
