# Victoria-lite
This is a victoria like game, except with more realistic features, no DLC ever, and save files will be transferable to a HOI4-like game(i.e. at the end of your game seccion, the map, technologies progression, population sizes, and 
political governce can be used for my HOI4-like game). Some bugs are expected becuase this was created by one person, but hopefully we can collectively fix my bad code. 

The author of all this code is "Tyler Brotherton" which is "tylerbrotherton" here on github and "tyler-brotherton" on LinkenIn
